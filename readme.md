# Welcome to Toasterlands Network Project

## This is my biggest project to date, which comprises of a Minecraft Website and Minecraft Network at the same time. I wanted to share it so others could use it as a base, as well as have a place to store it.

** Warning **
 
 * I am a Spanish speaker, so you will find all the content written in Spanish. *

Content:

Website

- Welcome Main Page
- Server Description Page
- Announcements Page
- Some Free to Use Renders

Network

- Velocity Server
- Lobby Server
- Survival Server

You are free to use this content, I only ask for credit for putting it all together.

Thanks
